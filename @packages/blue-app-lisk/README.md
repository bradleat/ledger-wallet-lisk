# Hello World App for Ledger Blue & Ledger Nano S

This application demonstrates the user interface and Secure Element proxy logic.
A simple "Hello World" message is displayed on the screen. On the Nano S, press
both buttons to exit.

Run `make load` to build and load the application onto the device. After
installing and running the application, you can run `demo.py` to test a data
exchange over USB.

See [Ledger's documentation](http://ledger.readthedocs.io) to get started.
